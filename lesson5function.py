# Python Functions

# They are a block of code/statements that performs a given task/action. They can be reused through out the program to perform different tasks.

# Functions are defined using the def keyword. (define)

# We have two main types of functions i.e:

# 1.  In-built functions -> They come preinstalled with the interpreter i.e print(), pop(), range(), append() etc...

# 2. User defined functions => They are created by a programmer to solve a given task.

# To define a function you need to give it a name followed by parenthesis.

# For the functions, it is usually indented and to invoke a function we use the function name.

def greetings():
    print("helloo")

#below we call the function by the use of its name
greetings()

print("======================")
#addition function
def addition():
    num1= 40
    num2= 50
    sum = num1 + num2
    print("the sum of numbers is: ", sum)
addition()

print("======================")
#create a function that is able to multiple values 3
def multiply():
    num1 = 4
    num2 = 90
    num3 = 56
    multiply = num1 * num2 * num3
    print("the multiplication is", multiply)
multiply()
